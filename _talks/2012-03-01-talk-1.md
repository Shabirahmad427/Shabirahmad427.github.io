I delivered an in-person invited talk on **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**
at **Jinnah Women University, Karachi, Pakistan**.

The presentation introduced the fundamental concepts of molecular dynamics,
including simulation workflows, force fields, and trajectory analysis, and
highlighted the role of MD simulations in modern chemical and biomolecular
research.

The event was organized in collaboration with the **International Basic and
Applied Research Society (IBRAS)**.
