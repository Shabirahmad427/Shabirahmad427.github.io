The **II CONESUL Symposium on Biomolecular Simulation** is a South American meeting focused on molecular dynamics and biomolecular simulation methods applied to biological systems, bringing together researchers from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and neighboring countries.

**Presenter:** Shabir Ahmad  

**Abstract:**  
This poster presented molecular dynamics simulations of a family of **glycoside hydrolase enzymes**, focusing on how enzyme structure and dynamics influence catalytic function. The work highlighted how biomolecular simulation techniques can be used to investigate enzyme–substrate interactions and conformational flexibility in carbohydrate-active enzymes. The contribution was presented as part of the official **II CONESUL Symposium on Biomolecular Simulation** poster session.
