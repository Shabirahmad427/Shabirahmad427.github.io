My research focuses on the application of **molecular dynamics simulations**
and computational chemistry methods to study **biomolecular systems**, with
emphasis on protein structure, flexibility, and conformational dynamics.

The work is primarily methodological and computational, involving simulation
setup, large-scale data analysis, and high-performance computing workflows.
Specific biological systems and results are not disclosed prior to publication.

### Research Scope

- Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules  
- Structural and dynamical analysis  
- Computational method development  
- High-performance and GPU-accelerated simulations  

This research contributes to the broader understanding of biomolecular
behavior and supports reproducible computational workflows in molecular
simulation studies.
