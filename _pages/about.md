I am a PhD researcher in Physical Chemistry (Theoretical) at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil, with a research focus on computational enzymology and molecular dynamics simulations.

My work investigates the **structure function relationships of glycoside hydrolase enzymes**, combining large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling and free-energy methods to understand **enzyme catalysis, loop dynamics, and substrate recognition**.

### Research interests
- Molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes  
- Computational enzymology and catalysis  
- Free energy landscapes and enhanced sampling   

I have hands-on experience with **AMBER, GROMACS, CPPTRAJ and high-performance computing environments, developing **reproducible, automated workflows** for large simulation datasets.

This website presents my **publications, talks, research projects, and CV**, and serves as a central hub for my academic activities.

📍 *Currently based in Campinas, Brazil.*
